  },
  {
    question : "Do I need to know how to code?",
    answer : "Nope! The usage of AI and generative development technology, such as Copilot, Cursor, Claude, and many others, is strongly encouraged for first-time programmers to introduce themselves to using technology in new ways. The goal is not to build your solutions from scratch, but to design them with the help of these tools."
